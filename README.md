## Introduction

In today's digital age, visual experiences are often confined to screens. **RotaryLady** breaks this barrier by utilizing laser beams to create images through scattering. This project offers a unique blend of artistic expression and scientific exploration. Whether you are an artist, scientist, or just curious, you will find something fascinating here.

## Features

- **Brightness Modulation**: Control the intensity of laser beams for intricate image rendering.
- **Rotating Mechanism**: Simulate rotating lasers to create dynamic visual effects.
- **Screenless Rendering**: Explore a new way of visualizing images without the need for traditional displays.
- **Light Scattering Simulation**: Understand how light interacts with various materials.
- **Photonics Insights**: Gain knowledge about the behavior of photons in different environments.

## Installation

To get started with **RotaryLady**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FroyDj/RotaryLady.git
   cd RotaryLady
   ```

2. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/FroyDj/RotaryLady/releases) to download the latest version. Make sure to execute the necessary files as per the instructions provided in the release notes.

3. **Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the following installed:
   - Python 3.x
   - Required libraries (check the `requirements.txt` file).

4. **Run the Application**:
   After setting everything up, you can run the application with:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can start creating your own light art. Hereâ€™s a simple guide to get you started:

1. **Select Your Image**: Choose an image you want to render.
2. **Adjust Settings**: Modify the brightness and rotation speed to your liking.
3. **Start Rendering**: Click on the "Render" button and watch the magic happen!

### Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to render an image:

```python
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
brightness = 0.8
rotation_speed = 5

render_image(image_path, brightness, rotation_speed)
```
